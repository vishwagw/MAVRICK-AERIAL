# detection and tracking of dangerous and unpredictable objects.

In this project, we are going to build a intelligent detection, tracking and avoidance model that can run on a computer such as Raspberry Pi.
In a real physical world, there are many unpredictable objects that can move and make a great threat to the UAV.
example for these kinds of objects/obstacles children playing frisbee, running pets, or flying kites etc. 

For an advanced autonomous drone, an AI-powered detection model capable of detecting **any** object in **motion** is essential.
